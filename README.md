# 🧠 HealthNER

This project builds a machine learning-based system to automatically extract key medical information such as **patient names**, **diseases**, **symptoms**, and **medications** from unstructured clinical text.  
It leverages **spaCy’s NLP capabilities** to identify and label these entities, transforming messy text into structured data.
